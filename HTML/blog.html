                    <br>
                    <br>Over the past several years Mrs. Vereda Elliot and her team at Eloquent Creations have catered events for Inspiration Networks -large events such as our Grand Opening and Christmas parties for our staff of 300, as well as smaller, more intimate gatherings. Each time the beautiful presentation is second only to the high-caliber meals that are served. The dishes are always delicious, served at the correct temperature. The hors d' oeuvres are plentiful and well thought-out.
                    <br>
                    <br>Vereda works with our budget, anticipates our needs and always does this with a smile. The attitude of her team and service they provide are of a very high level. We have never been disappointed and I do not believe you will be either!"</p>

You and your team went above and beyond to help make this event a success. The beauty of this is a lot of the people in the room were executives and they get quality food and service at their events, but there were people in the room that have not experienced such quality food and professional service.
                    <br>
                    <br>I'm so grateful for you (Eloquent Creations) and may God continue to bless your business. Thank you so much!"</p>

                    <br>Elegance, Class, Regal, Beauty, Superb! All words come to mind when I think of my "Sensational at Sixty" birthday party. Whether a guest entered the room before, during or after sunset ... the decor was stunning. My guest continue to rave about decor, the multiple options for seating, the flow of the serving line, the quality and taste of the food and last but not least the professionalism and friendliness of your staff. By the way, I consider myself a shrimp and grits connoisseur and I must say that "yours was the best I've ever had"!
                    <br>
                    <br>Thank you for making such a memorable occasion one that I will treasure forever ................It was truly 'Unforgettable'! Let's do it again :-)"</p>

                    <p>"It is beyond words of how Eloquent Creations Catering & Design Services made our event an affair of amazement with a flair that was beyond our imaginations.
                        <br>
                        <br> Mrs. Elliott and her staff demonstrated professionalism from day one. On the onset of providing our expectations, I was left with the impression that our event was in more than capable hands.
                        <br>
                        <br>The Harvey B. Gantt was transformed into a magnificent Caribbean island destination "get away". Not only was the decorating design breath taking, the food looked and tasted amazing. Eloquent Creations catered to us every step of the way before, during, and after the event. As the event coordinator for our family reunion, I am still overwhelmingly appreciative and humbled that I only had to walk into our event with everything taken care of down to the smallest detail.
                        <br>
                        <br>Our family reunion was a large event that included several people from all over the country, both young and old, that had the times of their lives. We literally walked into an area that was transformed perfectly for our family celebration. It was indeed a "WOW" experience that brought me to tears of joy. Everyone left with a memorable impresssion that will last a lifetime.
                        <br>
                        <br>Mrs. Elliott has a passion and is indeed blessed with talents that I assure will create any vision into a spectacular event beyond the imagination. Her tenacity along with a genuine sincerity has proven she will deliver results with the best of her ability. Her gift to listen and humility will place you at ease in the most challenging of times. Not only were our expectations met.....they were pleasingly exceeded.
                        <br>
                        <br>Mrs. Elliott you are quite a remarkable lady. <i> THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU to you and your staff for a JOB WELL DONE!"</i>

                        <br>Eloquent Creations went above and beyond our expectations. About the food OMG that's the first expression everybody says. It was delicious and beautifully presented. It was the main topic of conversation during the evening. Everybody said it was the best food they ever had at any reception or gala. You and your entire team displayed such a eloquent air of professionalism, not only in your manner but your attire also. Your name really speaks of who you are.

Vereda and her professional team are the consummate event catering consulting professionals. They help with every detail – from suggesting appropriate menu options and floral arrangements to assisting with room décor, linen and silverware selection. Most impressive is that they arrive on time, are always impeccably dressed and deliver a level of service and professionalism that rivals the dining experience of a five-star restaurant."</p>

                    <p>"Remembering my experience working for Ms. Elliott (the way the guests felt, the food and the atmosphere) prompted me to use her services for my company's Service Awards Ceremony. Ms. Elliott and her team did not disappoint our 200 guests and honorees. Her team arrived at the venue well in advance, decorated the serving tables and adding special touches throughout. Ms. Elliott and her staff were professional, courteous, and attentive to our needs.
                        <br>
                        <br>One special moment that stood out for me at the event was when Ms. Elliott recognized that those of us hosting had not had the opportunity to eat with everyone else. She personally served us when the event was over, requiring us to sitdown and enjoy dinner.
                        <br>
                        <br>As a hospital leader, I am often reminded of a quote by Maya Angelou that I share with my employees, 'I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.'
                        <br>
                        <br>It was this simple act that made us feel special and I will not hesitate use her services for future events."</p>
